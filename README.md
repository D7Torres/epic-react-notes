# epic-react-notes
This is a recollection of all the "Learnings" I elaborated on per the course instruction. The purpose is to have a summary of the learnings centralised so the whole course can be revised in a short reading session. This is for me, but I'm setting it as public in case somebody stumbles upon it and finds it useful.
